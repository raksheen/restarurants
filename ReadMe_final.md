User Stories

The user for my app will land on this page because they are searching for all the Pizza restaurants in Flatiron and want to ge more information. My page is separated into two sections. The top section has all the data from the API displaying. If you click on any of these, it will take you to another page that displays the information on them (a link to the Zomato page for that restaurant.

The second section is user-added restaurants. If you don't see a restaurant that you know is in the area, you can add it to the restaurants.
