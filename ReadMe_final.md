###User Stories

#The user for my app will land on this page because they are searching for all the Pizza restaurants in Flatiron and want to ge more information. My page is separated into two sections. The top section has all the data from the API displaying. If you click on any of these, it will take you to another page that displays the information on them (a link to the Zomato page for that restaurant.

#The second section is user-added restaurants. If you don't see a restaurant that you know is in the area, you can add it to the restaurants along with comments. And the site will consider adding your restaurant and all its information to the database.

###The approach taken

#Started with finding an API I didn't think was too difficult to use. Then I thought of ways I could do something with this.

#I wanted to do a project on flight prices and finding an API (requesting access and not hitting the query limit) was a problem...so I decided to change my project to something different.

###Installation instructions (if needed)

###Unsolved problems

#I have everything working except the comments a user submits aren't displaying on screen. They are however being saved to the Database...I've tried for hours to get them to show up.

#I've been sick for almost the entire unit...so getting this project done was challenging at times. I've been working with students to get help, the SRC and Dom.

#I didn't use many online resources, but the Beers-Am-Ex exercise was the most helpful for me to get CRUD to work and the Trains Comments was sort of helpful too.
